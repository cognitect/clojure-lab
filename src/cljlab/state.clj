;;; # State and Concurrency
;;; 
;;; ### Identity, Value, State
;;; 
;;; * Identity - a logical entity: wife, today, employer, shipping address
;;; * Value - immutable data: 5, "Bob", [0 1 2]
;;; * State - the value of an identity at a given time
;;; 
;;; Example: "today is April 15, 2015"
;;; * identity = today
;;; * value = April 15, 2015
;;; * state of today = April 15, 2015
;;; 
;;; ### OOP with mutable state
;;; 
;;; * Identities are pointers to locations in memory
;;; * Objects changed in-place
;;; * Updating state means overwriting memory
;;;   * Need to protect reads/writes
;;;   * No language support for coordinating changes
;;;   * Locking, deadlocks, and pain
;;;   
;;; ### Clojure's approach
;;; 
;;; * Identities are managed references to immutable values
;;; * Nothing changed in-place
;;; * References provide read/write protection
;;; * Language-level constructs to manage change
;;; * No locking in user code
;;; 
;; **

;;; ### Uniform State Transition Model
;;; 
;;; * `(change-fn reference function args*)`
;;; 	* Calls `function` on old state + args
;;;     * Function returns new state
;;;     * Different `change-fn` functions for different behavior
;;; * `(deref reference)`
;;; 	* Shorthand: @reference  (this is called a "reader macro")
;;;     * Returns snapshot of current state
;;;     
;;; ### Mutable Reference Types
;;; 
;;; * Synchronous
;;; 	* Uncoordinated: Var, Atom
;;;     * Coordinated: Ref
;;; * Asynchronous
;;;     * Write-many: Agent
;;;     * Write-once: Future, Promise (not really reference types)
;;;     
;;; ## Atoms
;;; 
;;; Atoms are the simplest of the reference types - they allow us to share a stable identity for a single value across threads. Changes become visible to all threads at the same time.

;;; ### Atom Guarantees
;;; 
;;; * Change is *synchronous* on caller thread
;;; * Changes are *atomic*
;;; * No locking
;;; * No deadlocks
;;; 
;;; ### Atom Caveats
;;; 
;;; * Values must be immutable
;;; * Cannot atomically update more than one at a time
;;; * Spinning compare-and-set
;;; 	* Update functions should be quick
;;;     * Update function may be called more than once
;;;     * Must avoid side effects!
;;;    
;; **

;;; ## Refs
;;; 
;;; * Share identities across threads (like atoms)
;;; * Coordinated change among multiple identities (different than atoms)
;;; * Consistent view of the whole "ref" world

;;; ### Ref Guarantees
;;; 
;;; * Change is *synchronous* on caller thread
;;; * Change can only occur in a transaction
;;; * Every transaction is *atomic* and *isolated* 
;;; * No locking in user code
;;; * Internal locking & deadlock prevention
;;; 
;;; ### Within a Transaction
;;; 
;;; * Consistent snapshot of "ref world" from point where transaction started
;;; * Transaction can see changes it has made
;;; 
;;; ### Ref Caveats
;;; 
;;; * Values must be immutable
;;; * Transactions are speculative
;;; 	* Body may be called more than once
;;;     * Must avoid side effects!
;;;     
;;; ### No Read Tracking
;;; 
;;; * Reading a Ref does not prevent other transactions from changing it
;;; * Transaction does not see changes made by other transactions
;;; * Enlist reads in transaction for read tracking with `ensure`
;;; 
;;; ### `ensure`
;;; 
;;; In this example, the fee may change during the life of the transaction and the transaction will only see the starting value.

;;; * `send-off`
