;;; # Clojure Polymorphism
;;; 
;;; 
;; **

;; **
;;; ## Motivation
;;; 
;;; There are many situations where it is useful to provide behavior that varies based on type or value. Clojure provides two different mechanisms for conditional (polymorphic) behavior: protocols and multimethods.
;;; 
;;; Also, Clojure provides two constructs that allow you to create new data "types": records (which we saw in collections earlier) and types.
;;; 
;;; Clojure was created with some strong opinions in this area:
;;; 
;;; * Only derive from interfaces, never from implementations
;;; * All generic methods should be defined in interfaces
;;; * Polymorphism doesn't require inheritance
;;; * Data is still immutable
;;; * No data hiding (aka encapsulation)
;;; 
;;; ### What does "type" mean?
;;; 
;;; "What is the type (class) of object x?"
;;; * `(class x)` or `(type x)`
;;; 
;;; "Foo is a type (class)"
;;; * `(defrecord Foo ...)` or `(deftype Foo ...)`
;;; * or Java `public class Foo { ... }`
;;; * Java primitive types - `long`, `double`, arrays, etc
;;; 
;;; ## Protocols
;;; 
;;; Protocols define an abstract behavioral contract. Protocols create a named group of generic functions. Each function has (only) parameters and doc strings, no implementation.
;;; 
;;; Protocols are polymorphic (choose the implementation) based on the type of the first argument (like methods in Java). Each protocol function must have at least one argument (the one used for dispatch) - equivalent to `this` in Java.
;;; 
;;; ### defprotocol
;; **

;; @@
(defprotocol MyProtocol
  "A doc string for MyProtocol abstraction"
  (bar [q r] "bar docs")
  (baz [q] "baz docs"))
;; @@

;; **
;;; Define a protocol named MyProtocol (in the current namespace) with a protocol docstring and functions `bar` and `baz`. These  functions both dispatch based on the type of `q`.
;; **

;; **
;;; ### Protocol dispatch
;;; 
;;; `defprotocol` creates generic functions. These are normal functions, just like `defn`. They are invoked just like any other Clojure function.
;; **

;; @@
(defprotocol Describe
  (desc [self]))

(desc thing)  ; Invoke it like this

(.desc thing) ; Not this

;; Similar to Java:  thing.desc()
;; @@

;; **
;;; ### Extending Protocols to Types
;;; 
;;; What if we want to add protocols to an existing type (for example, Java types like `String`)?
;;; 
;;; This is sometimes called the "Expression Problem". The problem  is how to enable extending either the set of concrete types or the set of generic operations while existing code continues to work.
;;; 
;;; Common solutions won't work:
;;; * Inheritance - can't inherit from `String`
;;; * Multiple inheritance - complex, not allowed in Java
;;; * Wrapping - complex, breaks type and equality
;;; * Open classes - no namespacing, error-prone
;;; * Conditionals - complex, not extensible without changing code
;;; 
;;; ### Protocol extension
;;; 
;;; Clojure allows extending any protocol to any type, including final Java classes. The type is not modified in any way. Implementations can be extended to both nil and Object.
;;; 
;;; ### `extend-type` and `extend-protocol`
;;; 
;;; Extensions are specified with `extend-type` or `extend-protocol`.

;;; # LAB: Rock, Paper, Scissors
;;; 
;;; In this lab, we will write programs to play the classic game of [Rock, Paper, Scissors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors). The rules are simple:
;;; 
;;; * Rock beats Scissors
;;; * Scissors beats Paper
;;; * Paper beats Rock
;;; 
;;; (For each section, the solutions are available at the bottom.)
;;; 
;;; ## World domination 
;;; 
;;; Define a function dominates that takes a keyword argument and returns the keyword naming the thing that beats it.
;;; 
;;; Hint: remember that data structures are functions.
;;; 
;;; ## Choices, choices
;;; 
;;; Define a vector of the possible choices, reusing the definition of dominates.
;;; 
;;; Hint: the `keys` function returns a sequence of the keys in a map.
;;; 
;;; ## Winners and losers
;;; 
;;; Define a function winner that takes two players' choices and returns the winner, or nil for a tie.
;;; 
;;; ## Draws and ties 
;;; 
;;; Define two predicates:
;;; 
;;; * `draw?` takes two players' choices and returns true if they are a draw
;;; * `iwon?` takes two players' choices and returns true if the first player won
;;; 
;;; ## The players
;;; 
;;; All the players will conform to a `Player` protocol. It should have two methods:
;;; 
;;; * `choose` takes a player and returns that player's choice
;;; * `update-player` takes a player, that player's last choice, and the other player's last choice, returning a new `Player` for the next round
;;; 
;;; Define the `Player` protocol.
;;; 
;;; ## Random player
;;; 
;;; Define a `Random` player who always picks at random and never changes strategy based on what the other player is doing.
;;; 
;;; Hint: Clojure's `rand-nth` function picks a random element from a collection.
;;; 
;;; ## Stubborn player
;;; 
;;; Define a Stubborn player who is initialized with a choice and sticks with it no matter what.
;;; 
;;; ## Mean player
;;; 
;;; Define a Mean player, who is slightly more subtle. The mean player sticks with what worked last time if it won, or plays at random following a loss.
;;; 
;;; ## Playing a game
;;; 
;;; Define a `game` function with three arguments: two players and a number of rounds. The game should return the two player's scores in a map.
;;; 
;;; This can be nicely represented as a `loop` with five variables:
;;; 
;;; 1. Player One
;;; 2. Player Two
;;; 3. Player One's current score
;;; 4. Player Two's current score
;;; 5. The number of rounds remaining
;;; 
;;; Try some games with various combinations of players. Do the results match your intuition?
